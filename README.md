# yelp-review-polarity
This is a working example of applying machine learning to predict the polarity or sentiment of a yelp review

## Source of Data
This data was obtained from a 2015 data challenge. See here for additional details http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge

The Yelp reviews polarity dataset is constructed by Xiang Zhang (xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the above dataset. It is first used as a text classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).

## Synopsis
This code is companion to my [medium post](https://medium.com/@ShoReason/using-fastai-to-analyze-yelp-reviews-and-predict-user-ratings-polarity-4e4e89df358e) exploring how to leverage FastAI and Transfer Learning techniques to be able to predict the polarity or sentiment of a yelp review
