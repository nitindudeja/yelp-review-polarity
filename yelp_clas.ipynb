       "  xxmaj they do have their non - negotiable menu . xxmaj it 's simple , it 's pretty and everything sounds good . xxmaj they have their set up assembly line style . xxmaj ordering is easy . xxmaj if you have any troubles , the employees in line will throw out a suggestion or two . i 've tried the xxmaj crab xxmaj avocado xxmaj melt , the xxmaj turkey xxmaj bacon xxmaj avocado ( i think you can tell that i like avocado ) and the xxmaj asian xxup bbq xxmaj pork . xxmaj the xxmaj crab and the xxmaj turkey were pretty good ( they 're paninis ) but the xxmaj asian xxup bbq xxmaj pork is sticky and kind of a pain to eat . xxmaj it is good , but i 'm better off buying a xxmaj bahn xxmaj mi . xxmaj bahn xxmaj mis are usually cheaper too . i have n't tried their salads . xxmaj they did n't seem interesting enough for me . xxmaj their soups are never hot , they 're always this awkward warm temperature . i 'm not sure if they could microwave them , but if i 'm paying $ 7.99 for soup and a sandwich , i 'd expect the food to be adequate . i 've tried the xxmaj lobster xxmaj bisque which is n't bad . i 've also had their xxmaj swiss xxmaj onion xxmaj soup that 's a temporary item . xxmaj it was good . xxmaj another thing is that their soup station was messy . i saw the assembly food line workers chatting amongst themselves , so i 'm pretty sure they had time to at least wipe it down . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj with the $ 7.99 combo , it comes with a slice of cold bread loaf and a chocolate dipped strawberry . xxmaj sexy , huh ? \n",
       "  xxmaj yeah , i guess it could be sexy ... xxmaj unless you think fruit bugs and leaves are sexy . ( xxmaj not judging if you are ! ) \n",
       "  xxmaj the first issue i had with the strawberries is that there were leaves xxup melted xxup in xxup with xxup the xxup chocolate . xxmaj honestly , how could you miss that ? xxmaj how can you expect your customers to xxup not notice it ? xxmaj luckily that time , i brought it up and they switched it out . xxmaj easy . xxmaj done . i did n't even have to ask them to switch it out . \n",
       "  xxmaj tonight was another story . xxmaj after my sister ate her strawberries , she started freaking out because a bug that crawled out of the bag . xxmaj it was a tiny bug . xxmaj like the kinds you find with the berries you did n't wash yet . xxmaj first , i brought the bag to the cashier . i asked if they wash the berries or if they even inspect them or whatever . xxmaj she 's like , \" xxmaj yeah , we wash them . xxmaj sorry about that . \" in the most \" omg , it 's late and i just want to get out of here . xxmaj it 's not my fault you have issues . \" attitude ever . xxmaj did n't offer if i want to talk to the manager or anything . xxmaj that was a problem for me . i 'm like , \" okay , thanks i guess . \" i waited for a bit and waited until a busser came by . i told her what happened and she brought out xxmaj joe , the manager . xxmaj joe explained to me that it 's corporate policy that the berries come pre - washed . xxmaj he said the chocolate would n't stick to it otherwise . xxmaj he then said they would keep an extra eye out when they inspect it in the morning . xxmaj he offered another dessert or another strawberry , which was nice . xxmaj we did n't take it , we were a bit grossed out by the bug . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj yeah , i can say ( with a lot of confidence ) that we wo n't be returning there . xxmaj ever . xxmaj not even if you paid for my meal . xxmaj if i wanted soup or anything like what they have , xxmaj panera xxmaj bread is down the street and xxmaj sweet xxmaj tomatoes is n't far from there either . xxmaj if you do go , just watch out for bugs !,xxbos i usually go to xxmaj francisco 's during my late night food xxunk . i have to say i really love their steak sopes ! xxmaj the sopes come topped with tomato , lettuce , sour cream , and cheese . xxmaj they are like little boats of fried goodness topped with juicy , tender meat and toppings . xxmaj make sure to ask for their spicy homemade salsa that they have in squirt bottles . xxmaj it has a real nice kick to it . xxmaj everything else on the menu is pretty decent . xxmaj my favorites are mostly the ala carte items : tostadas , tacos , and sopes . i do n't really care for the rice and beans that most of the entrees come with . xxmaj if you do stop in for a weekend late night snack , then be ready to expect a busy restaurant !\n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj so let 's start out with the good things ... \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the price would have to be the best thing it has to offer . $ 30 / night . xxmaj secondly , the bed was pretty good we had one of the upgraded rooms in the xxmaj north xxmaj tower . xxmaj the gym was decent . xxmaj we got the resort package which was $ 40 a day . xxmaj it seemed like it was worth it if you like unlimited beer / wine / cookies . xxmaj it also included the gym / spa . xxmaj they had a coffee machine which was broken and only had drip . xxmaj so no cappucino / lattes . xxmaj if you have an event at the convention center , this hotel is extremely convenient . i suppose this hotel would be good for you if you are one of those people that are always late . xxmaj the monorail is next to the hotel . xxmaj and that 's about it for me with the good things ... \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj now to my things that i did n't like . xxmaj when you have ghetto prices you get ghetto people . xxmaj go figure . xxmaj the pool was filled with kids . i am not a kid . \n",
       "  xxmaj you know , its the details that make or break these hotels . xxmaj the plasma xxup tv was nice . xxup but xxup no xxup hdtv xxrep 4 ? xxup fuck . xxup furthermore xxup these xxup assholes xxup block xxup the xxup input xxup in xxup the xxup tv ! ! xxmaj so , you ca n't connect your ipod / media player to watch your stuff . xxup fuck . i hated that the default setting on the xxup tv stretched the xxunk to 16:9 weirdly . xxmaj these assholes have the balls to charge $ 13 per day per laptop for xxmaj internet . xxup wtf ? xxmaj thank xxup god i have my wifi xxunk . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the lighting in the room was dim because they are stingy with the lighting . xxmaj they have those compact florescent light bulbs . xxmaj they are sooo ghetto that the light bulbs are n't even covered to look normal bulbs . xxmaj the a / c in the room was obscenely loud . i called them to fix it and the guy shows up an hour later . i forgot that i called him ! i hated the shower because i was taller than the shower head and i am xxunk \" . i further xxunk the shower because it was dark in the shower because these tight asses did n't put a light in the shower area . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj they give you a bunch of coupons , but with restrictions . i got excited when i first got a drink coupon but it had restrictions : no xxmaj grey goose , no name brand drinks . xxmaj jeez . xxmaj it was also good for beer / wine . xxmaj this place is in need of some major makeover . xxmaj the xxmaj benihana looks like when they first built the hotel 30 + years ago . xxmaj seriously though , if you have to go to xxmaj las xxmaj vegas on the cheap , you should wait longer save some more money get yourself a nicer hotel elsewhere .,xxbos xxmaj this is my second visit and it pretty much put a nail in the coffin . xxmaj the first time we came in for a late breakfast and the food was mediocre but we chalked it up to being on the tail end of breakfast service . xxmaj however , the second chance did not prove redeeming . i ordered the xxmaj cali benedict and the poached eggs were beyond runny and the dish was bland . xxmaj the potatoes are greasy and hard . xxmaj hubby 's omelet was greasy and runny , as well . xxmaj have not had lunch or dinner but would be reluctant to come back based on both poor breakfasts . xxmaj there 's other amazing places for breakfast in the area .,xxbos xxmaj first off , older casino on xxmaj fremont xxmaj street , but nice environment and incredible view of xxmaj vegas from the top of the building ( 24th floor , i believe ) . 16 oz prime rib was larger than that , incredibly done , xxup loved it !,xxbos i did n't find it that bad , but it certainly was n't good . xxmaj it 's a shame this place does n't live up , because it 's a neat - looking little diner in a great location . xxmaj service was typical xxmaj montreal aloof , food was not worth the time . xxmaj do yourself a favor and go to xxmaj cosmos down the street , or anywhere else at all really .,xxbos xxmaj the guacamole is definitely packaged - tastes exactly like xxmaj wholly xxmaj guacamole brand ... xxmaj not impressed . xxmaj service was n't much better . xxmaj food ? xxmaj very below average ... xxmaj after many years of using yelp , this is actually the first yelp review i have ever written . xxmaj that 's how strongly i disagree with the current rating that this place has . ( xxmaj and compared to what my friend and boyfriend had to say about the entire experience , i 'm being pretty nice . )\n",
